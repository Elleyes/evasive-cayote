# TDD Bookstore

Your goal is to make all the tests pass by building a bookstore like API.

**NOTE: DO NOT EDIT ANY FILES WITHIN /test**

## Setup

```sh
npm i -g yarn
yarn
```

## Your workflow should be

```sh
npm test
# fix broken tests
# rise and repeat until all tests pass
```


## More

- You should use a database of some kind
- You need to make an HTTP endpoint for resetting your database
- The tests only interact with your react app via HTTP
